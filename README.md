# Recognition-of-handwritten-digits-on-the-DIDA-dataset

This notebook presents an approach to handwritten digit recognition on the DIDA dataset employing standard machine learning techniques. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier is utilized for its effectiveness in classification tasks. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor is employed to capture distinctive patterns in the handwritten digits. Contrast enhancement, thresholding and morphology are used to prepare the string images for segmentation and classification. The proposed approach is a good starting point for future research.
